# Automated tests for the Solana Ecosystem

## How to run tests:

1. Make sure you have Cypress installed and the localhost server running in a terminal window.
2. Download the "**e2e**" and the "**fixtures**" folder and place their contents into their respective folder in the project's "**cypress**" folder and save.
3. Download or paste the contents of the "**support/commands.js**" file into the project's "**commands.js**" file and save.
4. In a separate terminal window/tab run `npx cypress open` to launch cypress.
5. Wait for the Launchpad to open and select "**E2E Testing**".
6. Select a preferred browser (preferably **Chrome** or **Firefox**) and click "**Start E2E Testing in [selected browser]**".
7. Navigate to the "**Specs**" tab and click on any of the the test files to start running :)
